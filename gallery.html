						<br>Title: Selfie with me and the stars
						<br>Semester: Fall/2019
						<br>Software: Photoshop
						<br>Description: For the raster project, I wanted to pick images that best described me in as little words as possible, after all a picture is worth a thousand words. The background of the si-fy plant represents the future and where we are heading, and the second background represents the scope we have towards the vast seemingly unlimited sky.  and the blend between the backgrounds shows how we are creating the future that we are seeking. The person on the hoverboard represents a hobby of mine (electric longboarding) together the picture shows the past on the bottom and the future on top and while I travel into the future I'll pick up some hobbies alone the way.

						<br>Title: vector based slife portrait
						<br>Semester: Fall/2019
						<br>Software: Illustrator
						<br>Description: For this project, I tried recreating the same self-portrait. I started by imagining a world were mirrors didn't exist, Then I closed my eyes and imagined how I looked like and tried my best to recreate that image. For this picture, I picked my favorite color since it reminds me of water. When I see blue and can hear the sounds of water flowing it helps me forget all my troubles as if the water is washing my emotions away. Throughout this projects, drawing with vectors was extremely hard. in the real-life, there are a lot of natural shapes that cannot be re-done with a geometric shape. I found that hair was the hardest thing to do, I was only able to over-come this by using the curvature pen tool. and meticulously adding small strands of hair together.

						<br>Title: Dreaming of a dream
						<br>Semester: Fall/2019
						<br>Software: Audacity
						<br>Description: it is human nature to rely on all our senses (if we have them), but what happens when we lose one of our senses? Do our other senses become stronger, does our body find a way to function without them? When I started the project I knew I wanted to present the idea of a dream, after all when we are dreaming, anything is possible. Without our sight and only our hearing left, can we still remember what’s it like walking around?</br>

						<br>Title: Politician getting hit with pie
						<br>Semester: Fall/2019
						<br>Software: Photoshop
						<br>Description: We all know the feeling of a corrupt or ignorant politician trying to save his or her own skin on the podium. And when we deal with them, sometimes we just feel like hitting them in the face. For this project I thought it would be funny if instead we could throw a pie at them when every they say something stupid.

						<br>Title: Ninja stencil a smile
						<br>Semester: Fall/2019
						<br>Software: After Effect
						<br>Description: For this project I took inspiration from those highly skilled people who could throw daggers, axes, cards, around people and create a very detailed outline of the person’s shape I also put in a sunflower as a sun. since I thought it would look funny (thinking maybe that’s where the sunflower got its name, by looking like the sun).

						<br>Title: Old Timey Screen Saver
						<br>Semester: Fall/2019
						<br>Software: P5.JS
						<br>Description: For this project I took inspiration from the old windows xp screensaver. The nostalgic feeling, I got from seeing something like this reminds me of the days before computers took over our lives. I really wanted to add a new kind of dynamic element to that screensaver where the user could also draw along the bouncing ball. I am very happy with what I have created, a ball that changes colors when it bounces off the walls and a soft peach color that you can draw with

						<br>Title: PSA for the city
						<br>Semester: Fall/2019
						<br>Software: Audacity/ Adobe After Effect
						<br>Description: Everyone says that they are all on board for helping the city but when it actual comes does it, most people won’t do anything. I understand why, I am the same too. Being a full-time student at school or working a 9 to 5 job with very little pay/ some people are even working 2 jobs. Who has time these days to help others when we can barely help ourselves? Hopefully the sort animation I created can change that and show everyone that time is created by us, and what we do with it matters. The future we create start now.
